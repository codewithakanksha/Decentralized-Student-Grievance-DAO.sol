# 🏫 Decentralized Student Grievance System

A simplified blockchain-based smart contract that enables students to raise complaints, vote on issues, and receive transparent responses from authorities (like Warden or Chairman), all with a built-in feedback and reputation system.

---

## 🧾 Project Description

The traditional complaint-handling systems in colleges often lack transparency, are slow, and can be biased. This smart contract ensures every student complaint is:
- Public
- Fairly voted on
- Automatically escalated if ignored
- Resolved by authorized personnel

The platform also allows students to provide feedback on how their complaints were handled, maintaining a reputation score for admins.
